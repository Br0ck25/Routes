    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 2, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect or store any of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Personal information (name, email, phone number)</li>
      <li>Location data</li>
      <li>Contact lists</li>
      <li>Usage analytics</li>
      <li>Device identifiers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <em
        >Note: While we do not collect personal identifiers, route logs saved by
        users may contain address and earnings information they choose to enter.
        This information is stored only for their own use.</em
      >
    </p>

    <h2>2. Offline and Online Storage</h2>
    <p>
      The App stores some data locally on your device—such as route drafts and
      user preferences—for a smoother offline experience. If you sign in, your
      saved route logs are securely transmitted and stored on our servers using
      encrypted connections. This data is used solely to provide your
      personalized experience and is <strong>never shared</strong> with third
      parties.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Internet Access</h2>
    <p>
      The App requires internet access to load maps, calculate routes, and sync
      saved data (if you're logged in). This communication occurs securely over
      HTTPS.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App may use third-party services including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Google Maps API:</strong> for map rendering and directions.
        Address information entered for routing may be sent to Google.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Browser storage (localStorage):</strong> for saving logs and
        offline data
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These services have their own privacy policies which we encourage you to
      review.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take data security seriously. All communication between the App and our
      servers occurs over secure HTTPS connections. Route logs are stored in
      your browser's localStorage and—if you're signed in—securely saved to our
      servers to ensure access across sessions and devices. We do not sell or
      share your data with any third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      This App is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not
      knowingly collect personal information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Account Information</h2>
    <p>
      When you create an account, we store a securely hashed version of your
      password and a unique token to authenticate your access. We do not store
      plaintext passwords. Your account data is used only for managing your
      saved logs and enabling access across devices.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      You can delete your account and all associated logs at any time from
      within the App. Once deleted, this data is permanently removed from our
      servers and cannot be recovered.
    </p>
    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. All updates will be
      posted here on this page.
    </p>
